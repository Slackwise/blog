      <p>I've had a personal website since at least 1997, which morphed into a journal or "weblog" around 1999. Unlike the famous John Carmack, I couldn't get away with just <a href="https://garbagecollected.org/2017/10/24/the-carmack-plan/">blogging through a <code>.plan</code> file</a>; not that anyone would have wanted to read the ramblings of a middle-schooler. But now it's 2021, and I feel for maybe the first time that I have some actually worthwhile things to write.</p>
      
      <p>So let's try this blogging thing again.<br><small>(How many times have you read this from a started-and-never-updated-again blog before...)</small></p>

      <h2>Subjects</h2>
      <p>This time I'll be writing about technical subjects ranging from web development to emacs configuration.</p>

        <h1>Short Summary Article Title</h1>
        <h2>A longer description of the article and what it is about. Maybe two sentences even.</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Yes, absolutely, I do
        indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. When has
        justice ever been as simple as a <em>rule book</em>? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Now, how the
        hell
        do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Fate. It protects fools, little children,
        and ships named "<strong>Enterprise</strong>." <a href="https://google.com">A long link to Google.</a> A lot of
        things can
        change in twelve years, Admiral. Well, I'll say <code class="language-javascript">this</code> for
        him - he's sure of himself. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?
        The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. What? We're not at all alike! I'm afraid I still
        don't understand, sir. Talk about going nowhere fast.</p>
      <h3>A Subsection</h3>
      <p>I am your worst nightmare! Travel time to the nearest
        starbase? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! and attack the Romulans. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you
        appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Your
        head is not an artifact! What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this?
        Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far
        less bloody. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on
        Lieutenant Worf. How long can two people talk about nothing? Besides, you look good in a dress. Commander
        William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are
        you up for promotion? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. In all
        trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! They were just
        sucked into space.</p>
