Slackwise's Blog
================
This is the code that will **_generate_** my blog.

The actual articles will be created from [my notes / KB][NOTES] which will be categorized/tagged as `#blog`, and published when the  `published` frontmatter metadata is `true`.

Infra & Rationale
-----------------
Details of the architecture and its rationale will be here. #TODO
